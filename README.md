# Smart Movie recommendation platform

## About

This repo contains the frontend of the final project of the course "Software Engineering" of UAIC's Faculty of Computer Science. Our entire class was divided in 3 modules, Frontend, Backend and Machine Learning, and we had to work together to create a smart movie recommendation platform.

After 8 weeks of collaboration in a AGILE environment, we managed to create a platform that recommends movies based on the user's preferences and the movies he/she has already watched.

**Backend repo:** https://github.com/stefan-nistor/movie-recommendation

## Features

- Complete user authentication system, with password reset and google authentication
- Customizable home page with a list of recommended movies
- An interactive movie search engine, that allows you to search for movies by title, genre, year, etc.
- A movie page that contains all the information about a movie, including a list of similar movies, other users comments and a rating system
- Users can create their own watchlists and add movies to them

## Technologies used

- React with Material UI for the frontend
- Java Spring Boot for the backend with PostgreSQL as the database
- C# ML.NET for the machine learning module
